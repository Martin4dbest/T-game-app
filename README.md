# Quiz Game with Integrated Minigame

## Overview

This project is an interactive **Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?**-style quiz game built using **Pygame** and **Tkinter** for UI handling. The game features multiple-choice questions, lifelines, and scoring mechanisms. Additionally, a **minigame** has been integrated to enhance user engagement, serving as a challenge that influences the quiz progression.

## Features

- Difficulty scales based on quiz performance
- Power-ups and penalties based on quiz scores
- Standalone scoring system for the minigame
- Required for progression in certain quiz sections
